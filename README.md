### Credit Card Fraud Detection

Credit card fraud detection involves identifying fraudulent transactions before they are authorized. This is typically done using a combination of machine learning algorithms and rule-based systems. Machine learning models analyze vast amounts of transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity. Rule-based systems, on the other hand, apply predefined rules to flag suspicious transactions based on specific criteria such as unusual spending patterns or high-risk locations. By combining these methods, fraud detection systems can effectively prevent financial losses for both consumers and businesses.
